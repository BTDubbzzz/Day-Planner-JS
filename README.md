# Day-Planner-JS

A Basic daily planner to add events in hourly time slots

This page allows you to input tasks into hourly time slots and save them to local storage. The application will tell you based on color of the time slots whether the time is current, past, or upcoming. There is also a reset page button to clear your entire page and start fresh with new tasks.
